# Warnings Intro

 * Mentors are here to help you, it is part of the program; please take advantage of this opportunity available to you!

 * If you're sitting on a question with no progress for 15+ min., it is time to reach out for clarification or help—think about the real world, it is better to reach out sooner rather than later.

 * Not all questions need to be big scary ones to enter the queue, get comfortable jumping in for even brief clarifications to get yourself back on track or check that you understand a concept or definition—mentors don't mind short calls too :)

 * Especially after COVID entered the picture, there are many opportunities that are in-part, hybrid, or totally remote—getting comfortable with screen-sharing and video calls is essential in today's industry, this is excellent practice not only for meeting online but practicing speaking in a technical way for interviews and the workplace.

 1. Primitive Types
 - Number
    - integer
    - float
    - Nan
 - String 
 - boolean 
 - undefined
 - Null
 - Symbol
 - BigInt

2. Composite Types

- Objects
- Arrays (technically Objects)
- Functions  (techincall Objects)

```js
const obj = {
    name = "Sakhia", 
    age = "102", 
    location = "MTL"
}
const array = [1,2,3,4,5]

const func = () => {
    console.log("Hello")
}

```
